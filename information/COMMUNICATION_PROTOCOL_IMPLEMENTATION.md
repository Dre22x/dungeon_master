# Communication Protocol Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to implement the communication protocol outlined in `communication_outline.txt`.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Player Input Routing
- **Updated UI/app.py**: Modified the `/chat` endpoint to route player input to the root agent, which then delegates to the Player Interface Agent
- **Updated root_agent.txt**: Added instructions for routing player input to the Player Interface Agent using `route_to_player_interface_agent`
- **Updated player_interface_agent.txt**: Modified instructions to receive player input from the root agent and send structured actions back

### 2. Session Management
- **Updated tools/misc_tools.py**: Implemented the "Clean Room" protocol where:
  - Character Creation Agent runs in the same session as root_agent
  - All other agents use temporary, isolated sessions that are destroyed after completion
  - Sessions are created with unique timestamps to prevent conflicts

### 3. Console Output Filtering
- **Updated UI/app.py**: Modified `log_agent_event` to only show console messages from the root_agent
- **Filtered out**: Messages from sub-agents (narrative, npc, rules_lawyer, etc.) to keep console clean
- **Maintained**: Debug information for troubleshooting while keeping user-facing output clean

### 4. Character Creation Agent Special Handling
- **Updated character_creation_agent.txt**: Added instructions to:
  - Only return control when ALL characters are finalized
  - Run in the same session as root_agent for seamless character creation
  - Maintain context throughout the character creation process
  - Continue until the player indicates they're completely done

## Communication Flow

### New Player Input Flow:
1. **Player types message** → UI sends to `/chat` endpoint
2. **Root Agent receives** → Routes to Player Interface Agent using `route_to_player_interface_agent`
3. **Player Interface Agent analyzes** → Determines action type and sends structured action back
4. **Root Agent processes** → Routes to appropriate specialist agent using `transfer_to_agent`
5. **Specialist Agent responds** → Returns result to root agent
6. **Root Agent coordinates** → Sends final response back to player

### Session Management:
- **Root Agent**: Maintains persistent session throughout campaign
- **Character Creation Agent**: Runs in same session as root agent
- **Other Agents**: Use temporary sessions that are created and destroyed for each task

### Console Output:
- **Only Root Agent**: Outputs console messages visible to users
- **Sub-agents**: Work silently in background
- **Debug Information**: Available in debug console for troubleshooting

## Testing Results

The implementation was tested and verified to work correctly:

✅ **Player input routing**: Player messages are properly routed to Player Interface Agent
✅ **Session management**: Character creation agent runs in same session as root agent
✅ **Console filtering**: Only root agent outputs are shown to users
✅ **Agent coordination**: Sub-agents work correctly with temporary sessions
✅ **Campaign creation**: New campaigns are created successfully
✅ **Character creation**: Character creation process works seamlessly

## Compliance with Communication Outline

The implementation now follows the communication outline exactly:

1. **Centralized Orchestration**: Root agent is the only agent that directs others
2. **Golden Rule**: Specialist agents never communicate directly with each other
3. **Route-to-Agent Tooling**: Root agent uses specific tools for delegation
4. **Clean Room Protocol**: Sub-agent sessions are temporary and isolated
5. **Character Creation Special Case**: Character creation agent runs in same session as root agent

## Files Modified

1. `UI/app.py` - Updated chat endpoint and debug logging
2. `tools/misc_tools.py` - Implemented Clean Room protocol
3. `agents/instructions/root_agent.txt` - Added player input routing instructions
4. `agents/instructions/player_interface_agent.txt` - Updated to receive input from root agent
5. `agents/instructions/character_creation_agent.txt` - Added session continuity instructions

The system now behaves according to the rules set in the communication outline, ensuring a robust, predictable, and scalable multi-agent system.
