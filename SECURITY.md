# Security Guidelines

## üîí Critical Security Considerations

### Firebase Service Account Key

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: The `config/service-account-key.json` file contains sensitive credentials that should NEVER be committed to version control.

#### What to do:

1. **Replace the template**: The current file contains placeholder values. Replace with your actual Firebase service account credentials.

2. **Add to .gitignore**: The file is already in `.gitignore`, but verify it's working:
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   The `config/service-account-key.json` file should NOT appear in the output.

3. **Use environment variables for production**: For production deployments, consider using environment variables instead of file-based credentials.

### Environment Variables

For additional security, consider using environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
export FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
```

### API Keys and Secrets

- Never hardcode API keys in your source code
- Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Use least-privilege access for service accounts

### Database Security

- Enable Firestore security rules
- Use proper authentication and authorization
- Regularly audit database access
- Consider data encryption at rest

## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices

### Code Security

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate user inputs
2. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries (Firestore handles this automatically)
3. **XSS Prevention**: Sanitize user inputs in web interfaces
4. **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for web forms

### Deployment Security

1. **HTTPS Only**: Always use HTTPS in production
2. **Secure Headers**: Implement security headers
3. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring

### Access Control

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimal necessary permissions
2. **Regular Audits**: Review access permissions regularly
3. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enable MFA where possible

## üö® Incident Response

If you suspect a security breach:

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Revoke compromised credentials
   - Rotate all API keys
   - Check for unauthorized access

2. **Investigation**:
   - Review access logs
   - Check for data exfiltration
   - Document the incident

3. **Recovery**:
   - Restore from backups if necessary
   - Implement additional security measures
   - Update security procedures

## üìû Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public issue
2. **Email** the maintainer privately
3. **Include** detailed reproduction steps
4. **Wait** for acknowledgment before public disclosure

## üîç Security Checklist

Before making your repository public:

- [ ] Remove all real credentials from code
- [ ] Verify `.gitignore` excludes sensitive files
- [ ] Check for hardcoded API keys
- [ ] Review database security rules
- [ ] Test with placeholder credentials
- [ ] Document setup process for users
- [ ] Add security documentation
- [ ] Review access permissions
